# Classification of Sugar Solutions Using Clustering

This project uses Python and K-means clustering to classify sugar solutions based on conductivity, sweetness (Brix),  and pH values.  
It includes data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization to improve the accuracy of sugar solution classification.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
- K-means clustering implementation
- Visualization of clustering results
- Accuracy improvement through parameter tuning

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- This project was developed using Python scripts (.py), primarily in the Spyder IDE, rather than Jupyter Notebook.
